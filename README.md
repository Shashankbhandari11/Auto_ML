#  AutoML Project: Automated Machine Learning for Model Selection & Optimization

## 📁 Project Overview

This project implements an **Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)** pipeline to streamline the process of model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation. The goal is to reduce manual effort in building high-performing machine learning models by automating repetitive and complex tasks.

---

## 🔧 Features

- Automated preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)
- Model selection from multiple algorithms
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearch/Optuna
- Evaluation using key performance metrics (Accuracy, F1-Score, RMSE, etc.)
- Final model deployment-ready
##### Note: For now this project is mainly focus on preprocessing and (EDA), Model Traninig and Evalution is for testing purpose

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** (for visualization)
