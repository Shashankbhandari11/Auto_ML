## Here is the link for the testing deployed on streamlit Cloud
(https://automl11.streamlit.app/)
## Project Overview

This project implements an **Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)** pipeline to streamline the process of Data Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation. The goal is to reduce manual effort in building high-performing machine learning models by automating repetitive and complex tasks. It is build in the framework called streamlit.

## Features

- Automated preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)
- Model selection from multiple algorithms
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearch
- Evaluation using key performance metrics (Accuracy, F1-Score, RMSE, etc.)
- Final model deployment-ready
##### Note: For now this project is mainly focus on preprocessing and (EDA), Model Traninig and Evalution is only for testing purpose

##  Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** (for visualization)
